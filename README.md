# mySql

In this project, we will be using a relational database called PostgreSQL to create the data structure for a vet_clinic. This database will be looking at the following;

animals
animals' owners
clinic employees
visits

Getting Started
This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

Use schema.sql to create all tables.
Use data.sql to populate tables with sample data.
Check queries.sql for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database. Important note: this file might include queries that make changes in the database (e.g., remove records). Use them responsibly!
